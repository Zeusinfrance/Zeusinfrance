- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zeusinfrance. Used to be 'someone' on Experts-Exchange (before it changed its business model).
- 👀 I’m interested in problem solving.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning/reappropriate languages having been out of the stuff for more than a decade...
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on specific topics/subjects, but not shying away either...
